Duo Case 24: Cultural Exchange

Problem definition:

In an increasingly globalized world, cultural exchange is more important than ever. However, platforms for authentic cultural exchange and learning can be hard to find. How can we create a mobile app that fosters genuine cultural exchange and understanding among users from different countries?

Main research question:

How can a mobile app effectively promote cultural exchange and understanding among users from different countries?

Stakeholders:

Individuals interested in learning about other cultures, educators, cultural organizations, potential investors.

Possible sub-questions:

• What are the key factors that promote authentic and respectful cultural exchange?

• How can the app provide an engaging and educational platform for cultural exchange?

• How can we ensure user privacy and security within the app's design?

• How can we incentivise user engagement with the app over time?

Do's:

• Document and test at least three competitor apps/mobile solutions. • User experience must be intuitive, customizable, and easy to use. • Prioritize user privacy and security in the app's design.

## Problem definition

> In an increasingly globalized world, cultural exchange is more important than ever. However, platforms for authentic cultural exchange and learning can be hard to find. How can we create a mobile app that fosters genuine cultural exchange and understanding among users from different countries?

Within different cultures there are major differences in the method of communication and providing each other of shared knowledge. The app should solve the underlying issue of differences within expectations and communication between different cultures.

### Questions

Leading question:

> How can a mobile app effectively promote cultural exchange and understanding among users from different countries?

The problem with this question is that it is both not measurable, time-bound nor is it concrete enough. What does 'effectively' mean? What does 'understanding' in this context precisely encompass? With these constrains in mind a new question was formulated.

> How can a mobile app facilitate in closing the barrier between cultures and languages using aiding features such as text-based translations, indicators languages/cultures.

This is a lot better because it is more specific, yet we are missing a concise and clear target audience as well as a period of time to bind the question to.

> How can we develop a mobile app in 3 weeks that can effectively utilize text-based translations and cultural indicators to bridge cultural and language gaps among international travelers.
