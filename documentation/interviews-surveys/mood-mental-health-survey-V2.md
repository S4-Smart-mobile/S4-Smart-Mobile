## 2.0 Mobile application context

Imagine there exists an accurate mood prediction mobile app. This app can predict your mood based on certain factors. You'd enter factors such as your location for the day, if you are seeing any friends, hitting the gym etc. After entering all this data, it will factor these in and look at previous emotions in relation to said data, and then create a prediction on what your most likely mood is.

1. Which scenario would you prefer?
   A. 4 or 5 'short' surveys throughout the day, which leads to less distraction, but less accurate mood predictions.
   B. 1 or 2 'long' surveys throughout the day, which lead to longer distractions, but more accurate mood predictions.
2. How likely are you to use such an app, assuming its predictions are at least +- 70% accurate?
3. What other factors do you believe could influence your mood that the app should consider?
4. How likely are you to trust the predictions made by the app? What would increase or decrease your trust in its predictions?
5. How important is real-time mood tracking to you? Would you prefer manual input or automatic tracking based on factors like location, activity, and heart rate?
6. Would you want the app to provide insights or suggestions for improving your mood based on the predicted emotional state?
7. Should the app offer customizable notification settings to remind users to input mood data at specific times or based on certain triggers?
8. Do you find it important to for the app to remind you every day to tell the app how you are feeling?

### How likely are you to use such an app, assuming its predictions are at least +- 70% accurate?

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis [Very_unlikely, Unlikely, Neutral, Likely, Very_likely]
    y-axis "Count" 0 --> 7
    bar [5, 2, 5, 4]
```

### What other factors do you believe could influence your mood that the app should consider?

- mood's of other people
- Mood fluctuations due to age (teens, for example have more severe mood swings than 24+ people), mental disorders
- if its to many administration or adds then i will get tired and angry
- weather, sleep, personality
- If I got enough sleep and had enough to eat or not
- Bier
- Music
- Diet, mental health issues that can cause mood swings, periods (can also cause mood swings)
- Quality of sleep, time of day
- Bad drivers
- memes
- Greater life events, kinda hard to actually implement though
- General life philosophy
- Situational disparity (so wether the situation is a lot different than normal, I feel like absolutes would lead to inaccurate results)
- I mean sometimes people look forward to doing something right? Like they are excited to go somewhere this weekend or something. Sometimes that can get you through your week. Idk tho
- Social interactions throughout the day
- No suggestions
- Schooldays, partner, parents (I know you said family, but maybe add something so you can choose what to track? Cause some people donâ€™t have work, yet, or donâ€™t see family much and then schooldays and family would be confronting perhaps)

### How likely are you to trust the predictions made by the app?

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis [Very_unlikely, Unlikely, Neutral, Likely, Very_likely]
    y-axis "Count" 0 --> 9
    bar [3, 7, 4 ,2 ]
```

### How important is real-time mood tracking to you?

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis [Very_unlikely, Unlikely, Neutral, Likely, Very_likely]
    y-axis "Count" 0 --> 8
    bar [5, 6, 2 ,1 ,2]
```

### Would you want the app to provide insights or suggestions for improving your mood based on the predicted emotional state?

```mermaid
pie
"Yes": 13
"No": 2
"Other": 1
```

Other: "I'd rather see how far away you are from your average mood, since general advice doesn't necessarily apply to the vast majority of people (especially when the advice is along the lines of "you're sad :(get happy by engaging in your hobbies :D", which is, imo, too generic)."

### Do you find it important to for the app to remind you every day to tell the app how you are feeling?

```mermaid
xychart-beta
    x-axis [Very_unlikely, Unlikely, Neutral, Likely, Very_likely]
    y-axis "Count" 0 --> 8
    bar [3, 3, 6 ,3 ,1]
```
