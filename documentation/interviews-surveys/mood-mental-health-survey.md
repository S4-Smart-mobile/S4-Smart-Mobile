## Survey results

**Why a survey instead of an interview-setting?**

The fear of asking these questions within an interview-type setting is the fact that the nature of these questions are quite personal and also a bit confrontational. They really ask a user to think about their mental/emotional well-being. The hope is that a fully anonymized survey will allow users more space to share their train of though next to the fact that a user has more time to think about an answer.

To ensure the privacy of the surveys participants, none of the actual answers will be added to this project's context. Only conclusions, generalized answers and anonymized data is shared. Underneath this paragraph, you will find 1 answer to each question, this is formulated based on all the respondent's answers. Within each question you will find, in **BOLD**, the most important information of that paragraph.

### 1.1 Can you describe a typical day for you, including your common activities, responsibilities and interactions?

Most (>80%) of the respondents noted having mixed schedules which can differ greatly between weekdays and weekends as well as during a workweek. A common pattern during weekdays was an early morning including breakfast, as most respondents seem to be students working part-time. What happens exactly during weekends is inconclusive, some work, some stay in bed for a large part of the day. A lot of respondents seem to have some type of part-time job which carries a variable workload, some use their off-time in the evenings, some use weekend. **What is clear is that a lot of these respondents have around 30-minute gaps in their schedules between appointments.**

### 1.2 How do you manage your mental health/mood on a day-to-day basis?

Half of the respondents noted that they do not actively manage/monitor their mental health. Those who have noted they do not actively monitor their mental health are the most busy, they fill their off-time with hobbies such as gaming, exercise or group sports. Other respondents have noted that keeping their regular rhythm helps greatly with managing their mental health, going about their days as they normally would. **Reflecting on how the day went with a bias towards the positive helped some respondents maintain a more positive outlook on their day.**

### 1.3 What are factors that influence your mood throughout the day?

**Most respondents noted that their ability to perform at school/work has a major influence on their energy level, which then leads to an effect in their mood.** Things such as their physical state (hormones, amount of sleep, ate etc.) also seem to bring both a positive and negative influence on their day-to-day moods. What people think of them seems to have a mostly negative impact, with compliments bringing somewhat joy to their day, yet social media, negative-feedback & bad work days seem to have a much stronger impact.

### 1.4 What are activities/habits that helped you overcome a bad day/barrier?

The answers here were very varied. Some respondents tended more towards non-digital solutions such as deep breathing exercises, journaling, talking to loved ones & self-reflection. However some respondents relied solely on digital means to get through their day. Things such as gaming, listening to music & watching videos. **Distractions would be a good way to group these variable results.**

### 1.5 Can you recall a time you struggled with your mental health, what were some of the barriers you faced?

More than 85% of the respondents have noted that they have struggled with their mental health before. With many problems variating from depressive episodes to body-dysphoria etc. Though this may seem inconclusive, it simply means that the users have a varied range of problems, issues and triggers for both positive and negative influences. **Which in turn translate to a very varied pallette of potential sources, meaning the problem is 'custom' to each user.**

### 2.1 What challenges do you face when trying to track or better understand your own mood patterns?

**Some respondents have noted that they struggle to find the right way to track their moods, tracking needs to be customizable, intuitive and take little effort in it's use.**

### 2.2 Have you ever used tools to track your mental health/moods?
